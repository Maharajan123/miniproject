## Technologies Used

- Java programming language
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database operations
- MySQL database for storing Ordered product information

## Code Structure

- `com.kce.bean`: Contains the `Customer` class representing the entity for a Customer with its attributes and getter/setter methods.
                  Contains the `Product` class representing the entity for a Product with its attributes and getter/setter methods.
                  Contains the `Order` class representing the entity for an Order with its attributes and getter/setter methods.
- `com.kce.dao`: Provides the `crud` class that handles the database operations for Orders, including adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving Ordered product details.
- `com.kce.util`: Includes the `DBUtil` class responsible for establishing the database connection and closing it when necessary.
                  Includes the `customerException` class responsible for handling the exception and it is a user-defined exception.
- `com.kce.service`: Contains the `Main` class, the main class that implements the Product delivery management system functionality, including the user interface and interaction with the           `crud`.

## Usage

1. Set up a MySQL database and update the connection details in the `DBUtil` class.
2. Run the `Main` class to start the application.
3. Follow the instructions in the console menu to perform various operations on Ordered product.
